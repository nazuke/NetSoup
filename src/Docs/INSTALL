=head1 NAME

Installing NetSoup


=head1 WARNING!

Please read the LICENCE before using this software. This software is heavily under development an may not work properly.

The installer has only been tested on RedHat Linux 5.1 with Perl 5.6.0. If you do not want to run the installation procedure you can simply copy the NetSoup directory to your $PERLLIB/site/lib directory manually. This is known to work for Windows NT 4.0 with Perl 5.6.0, MacOS 8.6 with Perl 5.4 and RedHat Linux 7.0 with Perl 5.6.0. Naturally, NetSoup will lack site specific configuration options.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ zcat NetSoup.tar.gz | tar -xf -
    $ cd NetSoup
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    $ su
    # make install
    # make test


=head1 DESCRIPTION

These are the installation instructions for installing the NetSoup class libraries for Perl 5.0 on a Unix-style system.


=head1 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

The NetSoup libraries require Perl 5.5.650, or newer, and a Unix-like operating system. The classes were developed under RedHat Linux 7.0.

To configure the software on Unix-like systems you will need a working shell, such as C<bash> or C<sh>. For other operating systems you'll have to brass it, although I do regularly use these classes on Macintosh.

Please bear in mind that because this software was developed primarily under Linux, much of it is heavily Unix based. However, because I also require it to mostly work under MacOS, I have made an effort to make much of the code compatible with that system as well. Unfortunately, because I don't use Win32 too often for any real work (who does?), there will almost certainly be problems on that system.


=head1 INSTALLATION

Assuming you already have Perl 5.0 installed, and that you have already retrieved and upacked a copy of the NetSoup tar archive; go into the newly created NetSoup directory

    $ cd NetSoup

and at the shell prompt type

    $ sh ./configure

This configures certain site-specific settings and builds the C<Config.pm> module. You will be asked a series of simple questions, each of which you may set explicitly or leave as their, hopefully sensible, defaults.

Note: As some of the Packages inside NetSoup are client/server based you will probably require different settings depending on what kind of machien NetSoup is installed on.

Next type

    $ make

This will compile any necessary files and builds the Config.pm module. There are no C/C++ extensions to compile (yet), so this should not take too long. Once you have done this you will need to become C<root> to install NetSoup in amongst your Perl libraries

    $ su

Once you are C<root> type...

    # make install

This will copy all of the necessary files into the Perl library directory. The installer uses the I<Standard Perl Library> C<Config.pm> module to determine which directory to install into. The directory searched for is (usually) C<Config{installsitelib}>.

Once everything is installed you may type...

    # make test

If NetSoup is installed correctly you should see something like this:

    NetSoup::Core   %1701    If you can read this then NetSoup is installed!

If not, oops! Something has gone wrong.


=head1 DOESN'T WORK?

If you cannot get NetSoup to install and function, then please e-mail me. I will look into it when I get the time. Remember to include the following details:

    Perl version
    Operating System and version
    Any error messages related to the problem
    A quote from Star Wars

Like I said elsewhere, I am doing this for fun, so please be patient.

Thanks for trying NetSoup!




=head1 MAKEFILE TARGETS

The following documents some of the Makefile targets that may be built independent of the regular installation process. This is mostly for my own use and seems like a sensible place to document it.

    make all

This makes everything and should be run directly after a C<./configure>.

    make modes

This sets permissions on all NetSoup Perl scripts and modules.

    make docs

This rebuilds the HTML, POD and plain text documentation.

    make STATUS

This rebuilds the STATUS document.

    make index.html

This rebuilds the index.html file, and the HTML format documentation.

    make html

This generates the HTML format documentation.

    make dist

This is used during development to build a new download archive and the web pages that end up on my web site.

    make install

This is run after a successful C<make> and installs the NetSoup package into the Perl library directory.

    make Config.pm

This builds a new C<Config.pm> module after running C<./configure>.

    make Packages

This runs the Makefile for each of the NetSoup packages, this is usually called automatically.

    make test

This should be run after C<make install> and performs a simple test to ensure that NetSoup has been installed, and runs correctly.

    make check

This target is used during development and does a C<perl -cw> on all scripts and modules in the NetSoup hierarchy, reporting any errors found.

    make clean

This clears out all temporary and intermediate files.

    make distclean

This cleans out all temporary, intermediate and configuration files.
