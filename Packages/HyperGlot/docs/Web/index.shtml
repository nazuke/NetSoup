			<h1>What is HyperGlot?</h1>
			

			<h4>Development</h4>

			<p>HyperGlot is heavily under development. What this means is that if I receive positive interest and feedback then I will continue to develop this package; if not then I'll work on something else instead. At the moment this package cannot be used for any real work as such.</p>


			<h4>Background</h4>

			<p>The idea for this package grew out of a recurring problem some of my colleagues were having. In trying to edit Html documents from existing web sites, for translation projects, they were having severe problems trying to get the pages to function correctly afterwards.</p>
			
			<p>One of the problems with web sites now is that a whole plethora (good word!) of tools have sprung up to try and make creating Html easier. This is all well and good, but most of these tools are for <em>design</em>, and not editing. Not to mention the fact that most of these tools seem to choke when presented with Html generated by some other application, or (gasp!), by hand.</p>
			
			<p>Personally I use a regular text editor, such as Emacs or BBEdit. So far I've not seen a nice editor on NT, any suggestions? However, the people who need to translate Html aren't generally programmers, or even techies. What they need is something simple, but powerful.</p>
			
			<p>I decided to attempt to use the functionality built into the two most common, popular, feature-laden web browsers available, and build my own system.</p>
			
			<p>What I've set out to do is use the text processing capabilities of the Perl programming language to extract the editable text on the server-side and send it to the browser display, the browser shows a copy of the page as it should appear; along with a navigation area and a set of text fields representing the text strings found in the Html document. The user simply edits the text strings and sends them back to the server, which re-integrates them back into the Html document. Simple!</p>




			<h1>Features</h1>

			<h2>Distributed Architecture</h2>
			
			<p>It is possible to distribute the various necessary software components across multiple clients and servers.</p>

			<h2>Multi-user</h2>
			
			<p>Multiple users are able to work on a set of pages simultaneously.</p>

			<h2>Back-end Translation Memory</h2>
			
			<p>Using the GlotD package, the system integrates with a persistent translation memory. What this means is that over time, previously translated strings will automatically be translated during the extraction process.</p>




			<h1>System Requirements</h1>

			<p>HyperGlot was developed under RedHat Linux 5.1 with Perl version 5.005_57. I always try to keep up to date with the latest Perl version as much as is possible. My particular Perl was built with threads enabled, so at some point the package may require a threaded Perl.</p>
			<p>HyperGlot is a part of my NetSoup library. This means that when you download NetSoup you are also getting HyperGlot, amongst other things. When you install NetSoup you will be asked if you would like to install HyperGlot too.</p>


			<h1>See Also</h1>

			<p>This is a large scale project that demands a lot of system resources, not to mention networking people who can set all the kit up.</p>
			
			<p>I'm also working on an alternative system for editing Html strings. This will take the form of program to extract and re-integrate strings from single files, or entire directory hierarchies.</p>


			<h1>Comments</h1>

			<p>If you have any comments or suggestions, then please mail me at <a href="mailto:jason.holland@dial.pipex.com">jason.holland@dial.pipex.com</a>. I'm doing this mostly for fun, but I would be interested in any comments you may have. Thanks!</p>
