WARNING: THIS IS VERY OLD CODE THAT PROBABLY DOESN'T WORK TOO WELL ANYMORE,
AND IS MOSTLY ONLY OF HISTORICAL INTEREST TO MYSELF.

NetSoup is a collection of Perl 5.0 class libraries and applications I have 
built over a period of time for processing text, XML and XHTML. As well as 
class libraries, there are also a number of small applications and frameworks 
built to exploit them.

The STATUS file contains details about which classes and programs are currently 
in the development stage, are in beta and those which I consider to be stable 
and ready for public consumption.

For more information about using these classes in your own scripts, please read 
the PODs located in the pod directories, or point your browser at the 
index.html file in the top level directory. However, as usual the code gets 
written first, and the documentation never; so in many cases you will probably 
just have to look at the code itself.
